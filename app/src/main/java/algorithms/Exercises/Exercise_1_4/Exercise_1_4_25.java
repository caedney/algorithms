 * Exercise 1.4.25
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Throwing two eggs from a building</i>. Consider the previous question, but
 * now suppose you only have two eggs, and your cost model is the number of
 * throws. Devise a strategy to determine <i>F</i> such that the number of
 * throws is at most 2√<i>N</i>, then find a way to reduce the cost to
 * ~<i>c</i>√<i>F</i>. This is analogous to a situation where search hits (egg
 * intact) are much cheaper than misses (egg broken).
