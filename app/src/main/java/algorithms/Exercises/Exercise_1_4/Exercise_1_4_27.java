 * <p>
 * <i>Queue with two stacks</i>. Implement a queue with two stacks so that each
 * queue operation takes a constant amortized number of stack operations.
 * <i>Hint</i>: If you push elements onto a stack and then pop them all, they
 * appear in reverse order. If you repeat this process, they're now back in
 * order.
