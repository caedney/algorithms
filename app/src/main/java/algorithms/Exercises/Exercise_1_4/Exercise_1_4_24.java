 * <i>Throwing eggs from a building</i>. Suppose that you have an <i>N</i>-story
 * building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg is broken if it is
 * thrown off floor <i>F</i> or higher, and intact otherwise. First, devise a
 * strategy to determine the value of <i>F</i> such that the number of broken
 * eggs is ~lg <i>N</i> when using ~lg <i>N</i> throws, then find a way to
 * reduce the cost to ~2 lg <i>F</i>.
