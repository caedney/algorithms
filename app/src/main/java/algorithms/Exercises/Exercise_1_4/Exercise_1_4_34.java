/**
 * Exercise 1.4.34
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Hot or cold</i>. Your goal is to guess a secret integer between 1 and
 * <i>N</i>. You repeatedly guess integers between 1 and <i>N</i>. After each
 * guess you learn if your guess equals the secret integer (and the game stops).
 * Otherwise, you learn if the guess is hotter (closer to) or colder (farther
 * from the secret number than your previous guess. Design an algorithm that
 * finds the secret number in at most ~2 lg <i>N</i> guesses. Then design an
 * algorithm that finds the secret number in at most ~1 lg <i>N</i> guesses.
 * </p>
