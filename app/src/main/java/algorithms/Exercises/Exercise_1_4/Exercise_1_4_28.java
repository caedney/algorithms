 * Exercise 1.4.28
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Stack with a queue</i>. Implement a stack with a single queue so that each
 * stack operations takes a linear number of queue operations. <i>Hint</i>: To
 * delete an item, get all of the elements on the queue one at a time, and put
 * them at the end, except for the last one which you should delete and return.
 * (This solution is admittedly very inefficient.)
