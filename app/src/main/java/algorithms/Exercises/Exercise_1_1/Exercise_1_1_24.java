/**
 * Exercise 1.1.24
 * 
 * <p>
 * Give the sequence of values of <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> that are computed when
 * Euclid's algorithm is used to compute the greatest common divisor of 105 and
 * 24. Extend the code given on page 4 to develop a program {@code Euclid} that
 * takes two integers from the command line and computes their greatest common
 * divisor, printing out the two arguments for each call on the recursive
 * method. Use your program to compute the greatest common divisor or 1111111
 * and 1234567.
 * </p>
